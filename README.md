# Solana dApp Scaffold Next

The Solana dApp Scaffold repos are meant to house good starting scaffolds for ecosystem developers to get up and running quickly with a front end client UI that integrates several common features found in dApps with some basic usage examples. Wallet Integration. State management. Components examples. Notifications. Setup recommendations.


```bash
npm install

```

## Build and Run

Next, run the development server:

```bash
npm run dev

```

Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) with your browser to see the result.

You can start editing the page by modifying `pages/index.tsx`. The page auto-updates as you edit the file.

[API routes](https://nextjs.org/docs/api-routes/introduction) can be accessed on [http://localhost:3000/api/hello](http://localhost:3000/api/hello). This endpoint can be edited in `pages/api/hello.ts`.

The `pages/api` directory is mapped to `/api/*`. Files in this directory are treated as [API routes](https://nextjs.org/docs/api-routes/introduction) instead of React pages.

## Features

Each Scaffold will contain at least the following features:

```
Wallet Integration with Auto Connec / Refresh

State Management

Components: One or more components demonstrating state management

Web3 Js: Examples of one or more uses of web3 js including a transaction with a connection provider

Sample navigation and page changing to demonstate state

Clean Simple Styling 

Notifications (optional): Example of using a notification system

```
A Solana Components Repo will be released in the near future to house a common components library.
